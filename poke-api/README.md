**Author**: Clarissa
**Version**: 1.0.1 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Use Django REST Framework to create an API, then “containerize” it with Docker.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Rebuild a custom version of Things API demo project from scratch.

Replace things_project and Thing with your own application and model.

Your model must have at least as many fields as demo’s model.

Your model must have one field that is a foreign key to user.

NOTE: You are not required to build any templates for this lab.

Modify provided unit tests in demo to work for your project.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
venv for virtual environment, Python, Django, Docker
